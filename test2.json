While ethnicity, class, and religion are influencing the nation's development, so too are pop culture and technology-an uneasy fusion whose impact is most evident in the institution of marriage.<br><i>Love and Marriage in Mumbai</i> introduces three couples whose relationships illuminate these sweeping cultural shifts in dramatic ways: Veer and Maya, a forward-thinking professional couple whose union is tested by Maya's desire for independence; Shahzad and Sabeena, whose desperation for a child becomes entwined with the changing face of Islam; and Ashok and Parvati, whose arranged marriage, made possible by an online matchmaker, blossoms into true love. <br>Elizabeth Flock spent close to a decade getting to know these couples-listening to their stories and living in their homes, where she was privy to marital joy, inevitable frustration, dramatic upheaval, and whispered confessions and secrets. The result is a phenomenal feat of reportage that is both an enthralling portrait of a nation in the midst of transition and an unforgettable look at the universal mysteries of love and marriage that connect us all.", "endDate": "", "id": 3381939221, "imageLinks": "http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=b7tdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70W99k7imQD7-R_t4yx93OJhbJAAkRwUI8cCqPWI3asLVu8pX17N89fJ1cplzXD9apC_M1yHyXYiEIjutnq1t5JkEWHT5Sjen1u3ullcn9U6CkT1BYZURGmW99xkGdfHz9peS1b&source=gbs_api", "pageCount": 360, "startDate": "2024/11/01", "state": "READING", "subtitle": "", "title": "Love and Marriage in Mumbai"}]
